# Othellinator
An Othello GUI that allows for multiplayer, single player against an AI, or even two AI's against each other.
Most code was developed by another however, I wrote the code in the Othellinator.cpp and Othellinator.hpp files (I did not develop the GUI, although I have developed a Othello GUI previously.  I wrote code involving the AI brains.

This project is run by running the main.cpp in the app folder.
